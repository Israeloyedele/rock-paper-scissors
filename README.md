## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Framer-Motion](https://motion.dev/)


### What I learned

**These are some of the things I learnt while building this project:**

- I learnt how to use Framer with react while building this project


- I also learnt more on conditional rendering and props in react






### Continued development

I want to learn more about using React to the best of my ability then move on to building more projects.





### AI Collaboration


I used ChatGPT when Debugging, add some CSS and Brainstorm Solutions
The CSS worked well, I had to find my bugs myself most of the time.
ChatGPT was helpful overall.
